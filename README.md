# Computational Geometry Overview
This project outlines four primary tasks which are expected to be completed using algorithms in Python:

## 1.	Convex Hull: 
Implementation of four algorithms for finding the convex hull in 2D:  
o	Incremental Algorithm  
o	Gift Wrapping Algorithm  
o	Divide and Conquer Algorithm  
o	QuickHull Algorithm  
  
After implementing these, we will analyze the results using different sets of points,
including scenarios where some points are collinear, and create a visualization showing
the steps of the Graham's Scan algorithms. This task also includes extending the convex 
hull algorithm to 3D and applying it to a set of 85 points.

## 2.	Linear Programming: 
This section involves implementing the incremental algorithm to solve a linear
programming problem in 2D, including solving a specific maximization problem subject to constraints.

## 3.	Delaunay Triangulation: 
This part involves the implementation of a Delaunay triangulation algorithm for a set of points in 2D.
The results should be visualized for different numbers of points,
analyzing how the algorithm performs as the point set grows.

## 4.	Geometric Search: 
This task focuses on constructing a kd-tree for a set of points in 2D and implementing a rectangular
range search based on the kd-tree. We will apply the algorithm to a set of 100 points 
and identify which points fall within a specified rectangular region.
